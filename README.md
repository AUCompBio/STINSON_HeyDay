## Motivation
Hey Day is a well known and historical day at Auburn University. It is no secret that the Auburn Family community is what makes Auburn special. As Hey Day dates back to World War II, during a stressful time, Hey Day encouraged the Auburn community to say hello to one another, get to know each other, and bring everyone closer together. The pandemic has undoubtedly changed and challenged our University in an unprecedented way. So lets remember what Hey Day is all about this year when we face time our friends, wave at another fellow HeyDay-er from a distance, or when we even execute this script.

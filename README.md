## Motivation
Hey Day is a well known and historical day at Auburn University. It is no secret that the Auburn Family is what makes Auburn special and that the Auburn spirit unites us all. Hey Day dates back to World War II during a challenging time among our campus and among many others across the world. During this time, Hey Day was established to encourage the Auburn community to say hello to one another, get to know each other, and bring everyone closer together. This year, the pandemic has undoubtedly changed and challenged our University in an unprecedented way. So this year on Hay Day, lets reflect back to our fellow predecessors and remember what Hey Day is all about. When we video chart our friends, wave at another fellow HeyDay-er from a distance, or even execute this script, lets remember to be kind to one another and know that we are all in this together. **War Eagle!**

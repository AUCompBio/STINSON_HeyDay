## Motivation
Hey Day is a well known and historical day at Auburn University and it is no secret that the Auburn Family is what unites us all and makes our community so special. Hey Day dates back to World War II during a challenging time among our campus, as well as many others across the world, and was therefore established to encourage the Auburn community to say hello to one another, get to know each other, and bring everyone closer together. This year, the pandemic has undoubtedly changed and challenged our University in an unprecedented way. So on Hay Day, lets reflect back to our fellow predecessors and remember what Hey Day is all about when we video chat our friends, wave at another fellow HeyDay-er, or even execute this script. Be kind to one another and know that we are all in this together. **War Eagle!**
